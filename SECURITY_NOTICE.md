# 🔒 SECURITY NOTICE

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: API Credentials Security

**IMPORTANT**: This repository has been cleaned of exposed API credentials, but if you cloned it before this cleanup, you may have sensitive information in your local copy.

### 🚨 Immediate Actions Required

1. **Check Your Local .env Files**
   - Ensure no real API credentials are in `.env` files
   - Use `.env.template` as a reference for required variables
   - Store actual credentials in `.env.local` (which is gitignored)

2. **Rotate Compromised Credentials**
   If you have any of these credentials, **rotate them immediately**:
   - Zerodha Kite Connect API keys
   - OpenAI API keys
   - Any other API credentials that may have been exposed

3. **Verify Git History**
   - Check your local git history for exposed credentials
   - Consider using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner if needed

### 🛡️ Security Best Practices

1. **Never Commit Credentials**
   - Use `.env.template` for examples
   - Store real credentials in `.env.local` (gitignored)
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Review all configuration files before commits
   - Use tools like `git-secrets` to prevent credential commits
   - Regularly rotate API keys

3. **Production Security**
   - Use secure secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
   - Enable 2FA on all API accounts
   - Monitor API usage for unusual activity

### 📁 Safe Configuration Files

- ✅ `.env.template` - Safe template with placeholders
- ✅ `config/environments/*.env` - Templates only
- ❌ `.env` - Should contain only placeholders (not real credentials)
- ❌ `.env.local` - Gitignored, safe for real credentials

### 🔍 How to Check for Exposed Credentials

```bash
# Search for potential API keys in your repository
git log --all --full-history -- .env
git log --all --full-history -- config/

# Check current files for patterns that look like API keys
grep -r "sk-" . --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "AKIA" . --exclude-dir=.git
```

### 📞 Report Security Issues

If you discover any security vulnerabilities or exposed credentials:

1. **Do NOT create a public issue**
2. **Contact the maintainers privately**
3. **Provide details about the vulnerability**
4. **Allow time for remediation before disclosure**
